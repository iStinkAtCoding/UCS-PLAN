(defun c:UE()
  (setq viewsize (getvar 'viewsize)); keep these at top of code so that they are calculated when the command is executed
  (setq viewc (getvar 'viewctr))
  (setq name (getstring "\nEnter name of UCS to save: "))
  
  (if (tblsearch "UCS" name)
    (progn
      (princ "\nThe UCS name already exists.")
